- 👋🏻 Hi! I am Paulo Salvatore ([@pausalpa](https://bit.ly/Pausalpa)), _**Mechatronics engineer**_ and _**Small-Medium Business Administration**_ Student.
- 🧠 I'm deeply passionate about technology and all the limits that it can break, from AI generating whole essays or pictures of myself, to automation making shorter a lot of processes. 
- 🫂 I love connecting with people and learning from everyone I know. I always make an effort to do everything with a smile and try to leave a bit of myself on any person I meet. (:

- 4️⃣ Along these 4+ years of professional experience, I have worked in different technical areas, like:
  - Software Development (Python, C++, JS)
    - ServiceNow (as a certified System Administrator)
  - Automation and Instrumentation
  - Control Theory
  - Electronics
  - Design Software (Electronic & Mechanical)
   
- 🚌 Also, I am COO of [**MaaSIVO**](https://linktr.ee/maasivo), an entrepreneurship related to improving the mobility of the Metropolitan Area of Guadalajara (AMG).
 
- 📚 I consider myself very responsible, never stop learning and I always drive myself for more. <ins>_Kaizen is my life’s philosophy._</ins>

- 🌟 My life’s mission is to become an entrepreneur using my passion for innovation and engineering to have the power and opportunity to influence the world. It is about giving life to many ideas that help and transform.
  - 🗓️ In order to achieve this, I seek to acquire knowledge and experience that allow me to learn and improve by 1% every single day. **Transcend.**
